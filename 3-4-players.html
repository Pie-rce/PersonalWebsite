        <p>If you are a no.3 player you should be able to play everything said before and the about to be told things with no mistakes. A  “Number 3 player”: be able to play the 12 minor scales 1 finger at a time, two finger chord progression of the 12 major scales. Along with the songs Fur Eliese, Clare de Lune, Prelude and Fugue in C major, BWV 846 and Prelude and Fugue in C major, BWV 846. This would show anyone that is classed in piano and knows what they are talking about. It would tell them that you know what you are entering into the realm of intermediate piano player.  </p>
        <p>When you reach a “Number 4 player”, you should be able to do the techniques said before but with triad chords up and down each scale. To be able to do it in an upward single note pattern and single note downward pattern. The songs that they should be able to play are the following songs.</p>
    <p>Fantaisie-Impromptu, Tchaikovsky - The Nutcracker Suite and Mendelssohn - Songs without Words.</p>
    <p>You should be able to complete these techniques and songs with no mistakes. Completing the technique for a number 4 player shows good understanding of basic song structure in music theory. It will aid you in becoming a much more advanced player in the future and create the framing of a house to do so.    A person that can do that can move up to a Number 5 player.</p>
